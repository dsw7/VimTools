# VimTools
An awesome, user friendly set of vim commands (and other configurations) for improving developer workflow! This repository basically just contains a `.vimrc` file that enables some basic settings and also defines some user friendly shortcuts for common operations such as substitutions, inserts, etc.  

### Setup
Easy! Start by grabbing the `dsw7.vimrc` file:
```
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsw7/VimTools/master/dsw7.vimrc --output dsw7.vimrc
```
